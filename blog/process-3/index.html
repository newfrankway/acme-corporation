<p>Machining is any process in which a cutting tool is used to remove small chips of material from the workpiece (the workpiece is often called the &ldquo;work&rdquo;). To perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and the work. This relative motion is achieved in most machining operation by means of a primary motion, called &ldquo;cutting speed&rdquo; and a secondary motion called &ldquo;feed&rdquo;.[7] The shape of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions, produce the desired shape of the resulting work surface.</p>
<h2 id=machining-operations>Machining operations</h2>
<p>There are many kinds of machining operations, each of which is capable of generating a certain part geometry and surface texture.</p>
<p>In turning, a cutting tool with a single cutting edge is used to remove material from a rotating workpiece to generate a cylindrical shape. The primary motion is provided by rotating the workpiece, and the feed motion is achieved by moving the cutting tool slowly in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the workpiece.</p>
<p>Drilling is used to create a round hole. It is accomplished by a rotating tool that typically has two or four helical cutting edges. The tool is fed in a direction parallel to its axis of rotation into the workpiece to form the round hole.</p>
<p>In boring, a tool with a single bent pointed tip is advanced into a roughly made hole in a spinning workpiece to slightly enlarge the hole and improve its accuracy. It is a fine finishing operation used in the final stages of product manufacture.</p>
<p>Reaming is one of the sizing operations that removes a small amount of metal from a hole already drilled.</p>
<p>In milling, a rotating tool with multiple cutting edges is moved slowly relative to the material to generate a plane or straight surface. The direction of the feed motion is perpendicular to the tool&rsquo;s axis of rotation. The speed motion is provided by the rotating milling cutter. The two basic forms of milling are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peripheral milling</li>
<li>Face milling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other conventional machining operations include shaping, planing, broaching and sawing. Also, grinding and similar abrasive operations are often included within the category of machining.</p>
