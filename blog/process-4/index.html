<div class=content>
<p>A cutting tool has one or more sharp cutting edges and is made of a material that is harder than the work material. The cutting edge serves to separate chip from the parent work material. Connected to the cutting edge are the two surfaces of the tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rake face; and</li>
<li>The flank.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rake face which directs the flow of newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle is called the rake angle &ldquo;α&rdquo;. It is measured relative to the plane perpendicular to the work surface. The rake angle can be positive or negative. The flank of the tool provides a clearance between the tool and the newly formed work surface, thus protecting the surface from abrasion, which would degrade the finish. This angle between the work surface and the flank surface is called the relief angle. There are two basic types of cutting tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single point tool; and</li>
<li>Multiple-cutting-edge tool</li>
</ul>
<p>A single point tool has one cutting edge and is used for turning, boring and planing. During machining, the point of the tool penetrates below the original work surface of the workpart. The point is sometimes rounded to a certain radius, called the nose radius.</p>
<p>Multiple-cutting-edge tools have more than one cutting edge and usually achieve their motion relative to the workpart by rotating. Drilling and milling uses rotating multiple-cutting-edge tools. Although the shapes of these tools are different from a single-point tool, many elements of tool geometry are similar.</p>
