<div class=content>
<p>In geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, or (100-gradian angles or right angles). It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length. A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ◻ ABCD.</p>
<h2 id=price>Price</h2>
<p>The square is priced at <code>
$ 4 </code>.</p>
<h2 id=characterizations>Characterizations</h2>
<p>A convex quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is any one of the following</p>
<ul>
<li>a rectangle with two adjacent equal sides</li>
<li>a rhombus with a right vertex angle</li>
<li>a rhombus with all angles equal</li>
<li>a parallelogram with one right vertex angle and two adjacent equal sides</li>
<li>a quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right angles</li>
<li>a quadrilateral where the diagonals are equal and are the perpendicular bisectors of each other, i.e. a rhombus with equal diagonals</li>
<li>a convex quadrilateral with successive sides a, b, c, d whose area is A = 1/2(a<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>) = 1/2(b<sup>2</sup> + d<sup>2</sup>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=properties>Properties</h2>
<p>A square is a special case of a rhombus (equal sides, opposite equal angles), a kite (two pairs of adjacent equal sides), a trapezoid (one pair of opposite sides parallel), a parallelogram (all opposite sides parallel), a quadrilateral or tetragon (four-sided polygon), and a rectangle (opposite sides equal, right-angles) and therefore has all the properties of all these shapes, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>The diagonals of a square bisect each other and meet at 90°</li>
<li>The diagonals of a square bisect its angles.</li>
<li>Opposite sides of a square are both parallel and equal in length.</li>
<li>All four angles of a square are equal. (Each is 360°/4 = 90°, so every angle of a square is a right angle.)</li>
<li>All four sides of a square are equal.</li>
<li>The diagonals of a square are equal.</li>
<li>The square is the n=2 case of the families of n-hypercubes and n-orthoplexes.</li>
<li>A square has Schläfli symbol. A truncated square, t, is an octagon. An alternated square, h, is a digon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=other-facts>Other facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>A square can also be defined as a parallelogram with equal diagonals that bisect the angles.</li>
<li>If a figure is both a rectangle (right angles) and a rhombus (equal edge lengths), then it is a square.</li>
<li>If a circle is circumscribed around a square, the area of the circle is π / 2 (about 1.5708) times the area of the square.</li>
<li>If a circle is inscribed in the square, the area of the circle is π / 4 (about 0.7854) times the area of the square.</li>
<li>A square has a larger area than any other quadrilateral with the same perimeter.</li>
<li>A square tiling is one of three regular tilings of the plane (the others are the equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon).</li>
<li>The square is in two families of polytopes in two dimensions: hypercube and the cross-polytope.</li>
<li>The square is a highly symmetric object. There are four lines of reflectional symmetry and it has rotational symmetry of order 4 (through 90°, 180° and 270°). Its symmetry group is the dihedral group D4.</li>
